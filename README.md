# 🌾 Assisting Agriculture Using AI

This project aims to support the agriculture industry by providing AI-driven solutions for:
- Crop Recommendation
- Fertilizer Recommendation
- Plant Disease Detection

Our goal is to help farmers and agricultural experts make better and faster decisions by using machine learning and deep learning models.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 **Crop Recommendation:** Suggests the best crop based on soil nutrients and climate conditions.
- 🌱 **Fertilizer Recommendation:** Recommends the most suitable fertilizer for specific crops and soil.
- 🦠 **Plant Disease Detection:** Predicts the plant disease and suggests treatments based on uploaded leaf images.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Modeling:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning (CNN)
- **Deployment:** (You can mention: Render / PythonAnywhere if you deploy)

---

## 📂 Dataset Sources

- **Crop Recommendation Dataset:** Public datasets with soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
- **Fertilizer Dataset:** Created manually based on fertilizer suitability per soil and crop.
- **Plant Disease Dataset:** 
  - [PlantVillage Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)

## 🎯 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Geethapallavi312/Assisting-Aggriculture-Using-AI

## 🔥 Download Trained Model
- The trained .keras model file used for Plant Disease Detection is large and could not be uploaded directly to GitHub (100MB limit).
